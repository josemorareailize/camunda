   * <h2>Stream or Activate?</h2>
   *
   * <p>As opposed to {@link #newActivateJobsCommand()}, which polls each partition until it has
   * activated enough jobs or a timeout has elapsed, this command opens a long living stream onto
   * which activated jobs are pushed. This typically results in lower latency, as jobs are activated
   * and pushed out immediately, instead of waiting to be polled.
   *
   * <h2>Limitations</h2>
   *
   * <p>This feature is still under development; as such, there is currently no way to rate limit
   * how many jobs are streamed over a single call. This can be mitigated by opening more streams of
   * the same type, which will ensure work is fairly load balanced.
   *
   * <p>Additionally, only jobs which are created, retried, or timed out <em>after</em> the command
   * has been registered will be streamed out. For older jobs, you must still use the {@link
   * #newActivateJobsCommand()}. It's generally recommended that you use the {@link JobWorker} API
   * to avoid having to coordinate both calls.
   *
   * <h2>Activation</h2>
   *
   * <p>Jobs activated via this command will use the given worker name, activation time out, and
   * fetch variables parameters in the same way as the {@link #newActivateJobsCommand()}.
   *
   * <h2>Termination</h2>
   *
   * <p>The stream can be explicitly cancelled by performing one of the following:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Closing the Camunda client
   *   <li>Cancelling the result of {@link StreamJobsCommandStep3#send()} via {@link
   *       CamundaFuture#cancel(boolean)} (the argument is irrelevant)
   *   <li>Setting a {@link StreamJobsCommandStep3#requestTimeout(Duration)}; the stream will be
   *       closed once this time out is reached. By default, there is no request time out at all.
   *       <strong>It's recommended to assign a long-ish time out and recreate your streams from
   *       time to time to ensure good load balancing across gateways.</strong>
   * </ul>
   *
   * NOTE: streams can be closed for various reasons - for example, the server is restarting. As
   * such, it's recommended to add listeners to the resulting future to handle such cases and reopen
   * streams if necessary.

   * <p>Command to create a batch of documents. Unlike {@link #newCreateDocumentCommand()}, this

   * <br>
   * <br>
   * <strong>Limitations:</strong>
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>The gateway does not guarantee the atomicity of the batch operation. If the gateway
   *       receives the batch but fails to create one or more documents, it will not roll back the
   *       operation. This means that some documents may be created while others are not. The client
   *       should handle this scenario by checking the response for each document.
   *   <li>Each document in the batch must have a unique name.
   *   <li>It is not possible to assign a custom document ID to the documents in the batch. The
   *       document ID will be generated by the broker.
   *   <li>The total size of the batch must not exceed the multipart request size limit of the
   *       gateway.
   *   <li>The documents can only be created in a single store. If you need to create documents in
   *       multiple stores, you must create separate batches for each store.
